### 🎯 Objective
Hack a simulated website in a safe, legal environment to get a hands-on feel for what an ethical hacker does. This room is a beginner-friendly entry point into offensive security.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts
- **Offensive Security**: Simulating hacker behaviour to find vulnerabilities ethically.
- **Brute-Forcing**: Using tools like Gobuster to discover hidden paths on a website.
- **Web App Enumeration**: Scanning for hidden admin pages that could be exploited.
- **Thinking like an attacker**: Understanding how hackers discover unsecured features in applications.

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Virtual Machine (VM)** – Provided by TryHackMe to simulate a real environment for hacking.
- **Linux Terminal** – Used on the VM to run commands and interact with tools.
- **Gobuster** – A command-line tool used to brute-force web directories and find hidden pages.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- First time using **Linux**, so navigating the terminal and understanding commands was new territory.
- Needed to get used to reading terminal output and interpreting what each result meant.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- How to **think like a hacker**, spotting what might be missed by developers or admins.
- How ethical hackers use tools like **Gobuster** to uncover hidden areas of a website.
- The basics of **web application penetration testing**.
- The **importance of securing hidden pages**, which can be a major risk if exposed.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
Tools like **Gobuster** are commonly used by penetration testers to find hidden or vulnerable pages on websites. These pages can often be exploited by attackers if not properly secured, so identifying them is a key step in securing real-world applications.

---

### 💭 Reflections
This was a really enjoyable first experience in hands-on hacking. It gave me a taste of the mindset needed to work in **Offensive Security** — where you're not just clicking around, you're thinking like an attacker. It also reinforced the importance of strong security practices for websites.

The fact that a simple tool like Gobuster could uncover sensitive pages was eye-opening. I can see how, with permission, a penetration tester could help companies spot these weaknesses before real attackers do.
